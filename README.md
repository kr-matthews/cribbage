# Cribbage [WIP]

This is a(n incomplete) single-page application for the card game Cribbage. A user can create an online room and play remotely against another user who joins the room. Alternatively, a user can play locally against a computer player, or two users can play locally.

If you want to clone the repository, you'll need to add definitions for `publishKey` and `subscribeKey` at `src/pubnubKeys.js`.
